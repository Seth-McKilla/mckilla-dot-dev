description: Learn how to connect a NextJS 13 app to MongoDB with Vercel using the MongoDB Atlas integration.
---

Welcome to the [SaaS (Software as a Service) Starter Pack](https://mckilla.dev/tags/saas-starter-pack) series. In this series we're building a SaaS app from scratch using bleeding edge technologies. The end goal is to have a minimal, ready to deploy application that you can use as a starting point for rapidly prototyping and (hopefully) validating your next SaaS business idea.

This is going to be an ever-evolving series; as the technologies we use change, so will this series. I'll be continually returning to the posts and associated repo to update them as new versions of the technologies are released.

## Prerequisites

## Deploying to Vercel

Wait, what about setting up MongoDB?! Worry not, Vercel has a seamless [MongoDB Atlas integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas) that we'll be using after deploying to have a MongoDB database ready to go.

### Deploy

First, we need to create a new project on Vercel. This can be done by clicking the "Add New..." dropdown button on the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and selecting "Project".

Next, we need to connect our GitHub repo to Vercel. This can be done by clicking the "Import Project" button on the Vercel dashboard and selecting the "From Git Repository" option.

Then simply click the big blue "Deploy" button to ship the app to production and automatically get a publicly accessible URL! ðŸŽ‰

### MongoDB Atlas Integration

The last step is to add the [MongoDB Atlas integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas) ðŸ‘ˆ Go ahead and click that hyperlink and select the "Add Integration" button in the top right corner.

The next few steps are pretty self explanatory, so rather than overloading you with screenshots, I'll just summarize the steps:

#### New Atlas integration

1. Select your Vercel Scope (your Vercel account where the repo we just deployed is located). Note: if you see that the integration is already installed, switch to the "Configure existing Atlas integration" section below.
2.
