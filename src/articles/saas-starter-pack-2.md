description: Learn how to connect a NextJS 13 app to MongoDB with Vercel using the MongoDB Atlas integration.
---

Welcome to the [SaaS (Software as a Service) Starter Pack](https://mckilla.dev/tags/saas-starter-pack) series. In this series we're building a SaaS app from scratch using bleeding edge technologies. The end goal is to have a minimal, ready to deploy application that you can use as a starting point for rapidly prototyping and (hopefully) validating your next SaaS business idea.

This is going to be an ever-evolving series; as the technologies we use change, so will this series. I'll be continually returning to the posts and associated repo to update them as new versions of the technologies are released.

In this episode we'll be connecting our NextJS 13 app to MongoDB with Vercel using the [MongoDB Atlas integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas). If you haven't already, I recommend you read [Part 1](https://mckilla.dev/saas-starter-pack-1) before continuing.

TL;DR - here's the snapshot of the repo with the below steps completed ðŸ‘‰ [SaaS Starter Pack](https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/saas-starter-pack/tree/Part-2)

## Table of contents

## Prerequisites

1. Everything from [Part 1](https://mckilla.dev/saas-starter-pack-1)
2. A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account

### MongoDB Atlas Integration

First things first, let's wire our app deployed to Vercel with the [MongoDB Atlas integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas) ðŸ‘ˆ Go ahead and click that hyperlink and select the "Add Integration" button in the top right corner.

The next few steps are pretty self explanatory, so rather than overloading you with screenshots, I'll just summarize the steps for both the new and existing Atlas integration flows:

#### New Atlas integration

1. Select your Vercel Scope (your Vercel account where the repo we just deployed is located). Note: if you see that the integration is already installed, switch to the "Configure existing Atlas integration" section below.
2.

#### Configure existing Atlas integration
