description: Learn how to set up a repository with TypeScript, NextJS 13, Tailwindcss, MongoDB, and Vercel for efficient and effective full stack development.
---

Welcome to the [SaaS (Software as a Service) Starter Pack](https://mckilla.dev/tags/saas-starter-pack) series. In this series we're building an app from scratch using bleeding edge technologies. The end goal is to have a minimal, ready to deploy application that you can use as a starting point for rapidly validating your next SaaS business idea.

_Note: Each section represents a commit. Keep your eyes peeled for the computer (üíª) emoji for the commit link._

In this pilot episode we will be setting up a repository with TypeScript, NextJS 13 (with the experimental /app directory), Tailwindcss, MongoDB, and finally deploying it to Vercel.

TL;DR - here's the repo üëâ [SaaS Starter Pack](https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/saas-starter-pack)

## Table of contents

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (I'll be using VS Code)
- [Package Manager](https://pnpm.io/) (I'll be using pnpm)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

## Initializing the TypeScript NextJS 13 App and pushing to GitHub

First, we need to initialize a NextJS 13 app with TypeScript and the experimental app directory. To do this, we will use the [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) command.

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest --experimental-app --typescript saas-starter-pack
```

_Note: Select 'yes' when prompted to use ESLint._

This will create a new directory called `saas-starter-pack` and initialize a NextJS 13 app with TypeScript and the experimental app directory. Now simple change into the directory, open it in your favorite IDE, and start the development server.

```bash
cd saas-starter-pack
code .
pnpm dev
```

_Note: Make sure to select 'Yes' when the following VS Code prompt appears:_

> This workspace contains a TypeScript version. Would you like to use the workspace TypeScript version for TypeScript and JavaScript language features?

This plugin adds a lot of nifty TypeScript [features](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/configuring/typescript#plugin-features) to VS Code.

Now you should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the default NextJS 13 app.

Finally, let's create a new repository on GitHub (I'm naming mine the same as local: "saas-starter-pack") and copy the second set of commands from the GitHub repo creation page. Here's mine for reference:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/saas-starter-pack.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Your repo is now initialized locally & remotely. Boring tasks are officially done ‚úÖ on to the fun stuff!

## Adding Tailwindcss

Next up is adding Tailwindcss. Lucky for us, Tailwind has exactly what we need: [Adding Tailwindcss to NextJS using the app directory](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs#app-directory).

‚ö†Ô∏è Ignore step 1 as we've already done this.

Rather than rehashing the Tailwindcss docs, checkout the below commit which has all these steps completed & boilerplate removed.

## Font customization

I'm an [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) fanboy so I'm going to use that as my custom font. To do this, we first need to install @next/font.

```bash
pnpm add @next/font
```

Then we simply import the font, instantiate it, and add it to our root html element.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx

import './globals.css';
import { Inter } from '@next/font/google';

const inter = Inter();

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
      <head />
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

While we're here, let's also add a few styles to the root page to personalize the welcome text (this will be the future landing page of the final SaaS app template).

```tsx
// app/page.tsx

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold grid h-screen place-items-center">
      Welcome to the SaaS Starter Pack!
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Last but not least, we need to specify a subset of the font to load. This is done in the `next.config.js` file.

```js
// next.config.js

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
    fontLoaders: [
      { loader: '@next/font/google', options: { subsets: ['latin'] } },
    ],
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

Looking much better already! üéâ
