Welcome to the [SaaS (Software as a Service) Starter Pack](https://mckilla.dev/tags/saas-starter-pack) series. In this series we're building a SaaS app from scratch using bleeding edge technologies. The end goal is to have a minimal, ready to deploy application that you can use as a starting point for rapidly prototyping and (hopefully) validating your next SaaS business idea.

This is going to be an ever-evolving series; as the technologies we use change, so will this series. I'll be continually returning to the posts and associated repo to update them as new versions of the technologies are released.

In [Part 2](https://mckilla.dev/posts/saas-starter-pack-2) we deployed our app to Vercel and connected it to MongoDB Atlas using the Vercel integration. In this post we're going to be introducing [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) to authenticate our users on the edge with the help of NextJS 13 middleware.
