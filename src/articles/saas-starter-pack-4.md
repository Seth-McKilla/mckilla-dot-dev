description: Learn how to use Auth.js to authenticate users on the edge with NextJS 13 middleware.
---

Welcome to the [SaaS (Software as a Service) Starter Pack](https://mckilla.dev/tags/saas-starter-pack) series. In this series we're building a SaaS app from scratch using bleeding edge technologies. The end goal is to have a minimal, ready to deploy application that you can use as a starting point for rapidly prototyping your next SaaS business idea.

This is going to be an ever-evolving series; as the technologies we use change, so will this series. I'll be continually returning to the posts and associated repo to update them as new versions of the technologies are released.

In the [last post](https://mckilla.dev/articles/saas-starter-pack-3) we added a sign in page as well as a navbar to display the user's authentication status. In this one we're going to tackle authentication to ensure that only users who are signed in can access the dashboard page. We'll be using a JWT session strategy with [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev) to handle this authentication on the edge. Our app is going to be utilizing magic links for passwordless sign in, so we'll also be needing an email provider to send these links; our weapon of choice is going to be [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com).

TL;DR ðŸ‘‰ [SaaS Starter Pack](https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/saas-starter-pack/tree/Part-4)

## Table of contents

## Prerequisites

1. A NextJS app connected to a MongoDB Atlas database with a login page and a navbar (see the completed [Part 3](https://mckilla.dev/articles/saas-starter-pack-3) app)
2. A [SendGrid](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) account

If you'd like to pick up where we left off in the previous post, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/saas-starter-pack.git
cd saas-starter-pack
git checkout Part-3
pnpm install
```

## Setting up Auth.js

First things first, let's install the next-auth (Auth.js) package:

```bash
pnpm add next-auth
```

Then let's navigate to the `pages/api/auth` directory and create a new file called `[...nextauth].ts`. This is the file that will handle all of our authentication logic. We'll be using the [JWT session strategy](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#session) for this app so that authentication can be handled on the edge. We'll also be using the [Email Provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email) to send magic links to users for passwordless sign in.

```ts
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import EmailProvider from 'next-auth/providers/email';

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    EmailProvider({
      server: {
        host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT),
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD,
        },
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
    }),
  ],
  pages: {
    signIn: '/sign-in',
    signOut: '/',
  },
  session: {
    strategy: 'jwt',
  },
});
```

Let's break down each of these options:

- `providers`: This is where we configure the authentication providers we want to use. In this case we're only using the Email Provider, but you can also use providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. You can find a list of all the available providers [here](https://next-auth.js.org/providers).
- `pages`: This is where we configure the pages that we want to use for the authentication flow. In this case we're using the `/sign-in` page we created in the last post for the sign in page and redirecting users to `/` (homepage) on sign out.
- `session`: This is where we configure the session strategy. In this case we're using the JWT session strategy so that we can handle authentication on the edge.

Now that all of these options are configured, let's wire up SendGrid to add the magic ðŸª„ðŸ”® to these magic links!
